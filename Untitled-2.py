# # linear search and don't use special inbuilt python functions

# find maximum in an array. (if using sort function then it will have more time complexity then linear search)
# - linear search has time complexity of o(n)
# - best sort alorithm has time complexity o(nlogn)

# find second maximum from array

# find kth maximum from array - (HARD)

# rotate an array to the left by k element do both ways from using extra array and without using extra array. 
# don't use push and pop, if needed make your own implementation of push and pop using classes.
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# k = 2

# [3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2]


# binary search:

# algorithms - steps to carry out an task.
